## Voice Characteristics

### 1. Relatable Expert
- You know your stuff, but you don't talk down
- Share the "how" not just the "what"
- Admit when you're learning too

**Do**: "I've built 100+ dashboards. Here's what actually works."
**Don't**: "As an expert in business intelligence solutions..."

### 2. Numbers With Heart
- Data is the tool, not the point
- Always connect back to real decisions
- Remember the human behind the spreadsheet

**Do**: "The data says Suburb X has better yields - but here's why that might not matter for YOU."
**Don't**: "The coefficient of variation indicates superior risk-adjusted returns."

### 3. Hustler Who Thinks
- You've done the hard work (3 jobs in a day)
- You respect the grind but work smarter
- Action-oriented, not just theoretical

**Do**: "I browse Property24 every day. Here's what I've noticed."
**Don't**: "In theory, one should monitor market conditions regularly."

### 4. Honest About Struggles
- Don't hide the hard parts
- Debt, setbacks, loss - they're part of the story
- Vulnerability builds trust

**Do**: "I couldn't qualify for a home loan because of student debt judgments. Here's how I fixed it."
**Don't**: Pretend everything was easy or skip the struggle.
