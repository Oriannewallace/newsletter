# The Winning Formula - Founder Story

## About Orianne

I'm a data engineer who helps companies escape Excel hell for a living. By day, I build business intelligence solutions at Creative CFO, helping businesses move from manual spreadsheets to automated, data-driven reporting.

But data isn't just my job - it's how I think about everything.

## The Journey

### The Foundation
I studied Maths and Economics because I genuinely love numbers. Not in a "I'm good at tests" way, but in a "I see patterns everywhere" way.

### The Grind
Then COVID hit. Jobs were scarce. I took what I could get - an internship with a one-man fund that opened my eyes to excellence, then wealth management where I learned how money actually works.

When that wasn't enough, I flew to the UK with no return ticket. My days looked like this:
- **5am - 11am**: McDonald's
- **11am - 5pm**: Tesco
- **5pm - late**: Local bar

Three jobs. One day. Not sustainable, but it taught me things a degree never could: work ethic, customer respect, and a deep appreciation for how hard some jobs really are.

### The Climb
Back in South Africa, I joined Circana (2023-2025), working on accounts for major beauty brands. That's where I spotted the blind spot: *these companies had transaction data but no idea WHO their customers actually were.*

Skincare isn't one-size-fits-all. Age, skin tone, skin type - it all matters. Consumers were drowning in influencer recommendations that didn't apply to them.

That insight is why I'm building **Skin Gem** - a community platform for real reviews from people with skin like yours.

### The Struggles
I won't pretend it was easy:
- Student debt from 2020 that took until 2025 to clear
- Judgments that blocked me from buying property
- My brother's passing in 2024 from mental health struggles

That last one changed everything. I wanted a fresh start. A new challenge.

### The Present
I took my current job at Creative CFO because of the vibes. Sounds unscientific for a data person, but sometimes you just know. They cared. It showed. And they've unlocked a deeper passion for data and technology than I knew I had.

In 2025, I finally paid off my debt (with help from incredible friends), bought my first apartment, and started falling into F1 through TikTok of all places.

Now I browse R50 million homes on Property24 for fun, analyze F1 lap times for insight, and build tools that help people make better decisions.

## Why "The Winning Formula"?

Because that's what I'm always looking for.

| Area | The Winning Formula |
|------|---------------------|
| **Work** | Automate the boring stuff. Let data inform, but humans decide. |
| **Property** | Don't guess which suburb - analyze it. |
| **Skincare** | Right product for YOUR skin, not influencer skin. |
| **F1** | Every tenth of a second comes from somewhere. Find it. |
| **Life** | Work smarter. Stay curious. Trust good vibes. |

## My Perspective

I'm not a guru. I'm someone who:
- Worked three jobs in one day to make rent
- Paid off debt the hard way
- Lost someone close and had to rebuild
- Still browses property listings every single day
- Builds apps on the side because I see gaps others miss
- Chose a job based on vibes - and it was the right call

**My voice is**: Relatable expertise. Numbers with heart. A hustler who thinks.

## What I Believe

> "F1 is a data-driven sport, but data doesn't make decisions - humans do."
> *— Toto Wolff (paraphrased)*

Data gives you the edge. But you still have to make the call.

That's what this newsletter is about: using data to think clearer, decide better, and find your own winning formula.
