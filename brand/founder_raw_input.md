# Founder Story - Raw Input
*Captured: January 14, 2026*

## Original Words (Unedited)

I always enjoyed maths and stats, and that's why I decided to major in both maths and economics. After uni it was COVID and I really struggled to find a job. I had an internship with a 1 man team - he was working in funds, he had his own fund and really opened up my eyes to how amazing some people are at their jobs.

I then worked for a wealth management firm, managing the finances and helping with the admin side of people's wealth, interacting with service providers and clients.

I then left this job and went to the UK for 6 months. I didn't have a planned date to come back but as soon as I arrived in UK, I wanted to work as much as I can to generate as much money to be able to come back to Cape Town to look for work.

### The UK Hustle

My working day looked like this on a usual day:
- **5am - 11am**: McDonald's
- **11am - 5pm**: Tesco
- **5pm until late**: Local bar

It was definitely not sustainable but taught me to work hard, treat customers right, and taught me how labour intensive these jobs were.

### Property Interest

I have always been interested in property. In the past I go on Property24 every day just to see what homes are out there - stuff outside of my budget like 50 million rand homes, as well as to see the rentals on current apartments in the area I'm interested in.

### Skincare & Beauty (Circana 2023-2025)

I worked on the accounts of large beauty companies in South Africa when I worked at Circana from 2023 to 2025. And I thought to myself there is definitely a blind spot in the beauty industry data analytics.

They are looking at transactional data but have no clue who these people are. Skincare works differently for different people based on age, skin tone, and skin type.

I felt there must be a better way these brands are making decisions, as well as a better way for consumers to make decisions. They want to hear reviews based on people like them and they need a platform that has all the reviews in one place (unfiltered reviews), instead of going through Facebook, Reddit and friends etc.

So that's why I'm building **Skin Gem** - for now I'm calling it Skin Gem because it's to help people find their skin and beauty gems through community, as well as a place to share.

### F1 Journey (2025)

In 2025, I kept seeing F1 TikToks come up and I started becoming interested in the sport and wanting to get more into the data side of it.

Toto Wolff once said that F1 is a data driven sport but data doesn't make decisions, humans do. *(Note: exact quote to be verified)*

### The Common Thread

So the basis of my interests are data and technology, I would say. I'm trying to work smarter and not harder. I'm trying to find the winning formula. Hehe.

### The Struggles

Underlying all of this are struggles I have gone through:

- **Student debt** that I only paid off this year (2025), from 2020
- **Judgments** from that student debt stopping me from qualifying for property
- I successfully paid off the debt with the help of friends in 2025
- Shortly after, I **bought my first apartment**

Also my brother struggled with mental health and he unfortunately **passed away in 2024**.

That reminds me - the reason I wanted to change jobs at the end of 2024 is because I wanted a new challenge. My brother had passed and I guess I wanted a fresh start.

### Current Role - Creative CFO

My current job I'm super grateful for. It has unlocked my further passion for data and technology, allowing me to work with the best tech.

I decided to take the job based on the way they made me feel and the vibes they gave. And I'm grateful I decided to act on that vibe I got from them.

It's a great company that cares.
