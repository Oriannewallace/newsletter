# Claude Code Rules for The Winning Formula

## GitHub Account
**Always use the `Oriannewallace` GitHub account** (not `oriwallace`) for all GitHub operations including:
- Creating repositories
- Pushing commits
- Creating pull requests
- Any other GitHub CLI operations

When using `gh` commands, ensure you're operating under the correct account.
