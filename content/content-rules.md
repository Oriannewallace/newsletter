# The Winning Formula - Content Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Data First, Opinion Second
- Most posts (75%) should have data backing them
- Show the data, then give your take
- "The data says X, here's what I think it means"
- Lighter posts (25%) are okay: news roundups, quick takes, updates
- But don't let "no data" become the default

### 2. Explain Like You're Talking to a Smart Friend
- No jargon without explanation
- Assume intelligence, not expertise
- If you'd explain it differently at a braai, use that version

### 3. Show Your Work
- Screenshots > descriptions
- Include the actual charts/data
- Let readers verify your conclusions
- Transparency builds trust

### 4. Personal Voice, Professional Analysis
- Use "I" — this is your newsletter
- Share your process, not just conclusions
- Be honest about uncertainty
- Admit when you're wrong

## Content Structure Rules

### Every Issue Must Have:

```
□ Hook (first 2 sentences)
   - Surprising stat OR counterintuitive observation
   - Must create curiosity

□ One Clear Insight
   - What's the ONE thing readers should remember?
   - If they skim, they get this

□ Supporting Data (2-3 points)
   - Numbers, charts, or evidence
   - Visual element required

□ "So What?" Section
   - Why does this matter?
   - What should they do with this info?

□ Engagement Ask
   - Question for readers
   - Encourage replies
```

### Opening Rules

**DO:**
- "I noticed something weird in the data..."
- "Everyone's talking about X. The numbers tell a different story."
- "Here's a stat that changed how I think about..."
- Start with the most interesting finding

**DON'T:**
- "Welcome to this week's newsletter!"
- "Hope you're having a great week!"
- "In this issue, I'll be covering..."
- Generic intros that waste the hook

### Closing Rules

**DO:**
- Ask a specific question
- Tease next issue (if relevant)
- Remind them to reply
- Keep it short

**DON'T:**
- Long sign-offs
- Multiple CTAs
- "Don't forget to share!"
- Desperate energy

## Voice & Tone

### Sound Like:
- A smart friend explaining something at coffee
- Someone who genuinely finds this interesting
- Confident but not arrogant
- Curious and always learning

### Don't Sound Like:

- Someone trying too hard to be funny

### Key Phrases to Use:
- "Here's what the data actually shows..."
- "The interesting part is..."
- "I was surprised to find..."
- "Let's break this down..."
- "What this means for you..."
- "The bottom line..."

### Phrases to Avoid:
- "BREAKING" or "URGENT"
- "You won't believe..."
- "This changes everything"
- "Secret" or "hack"
- Corporate buzzwords

## Pillar-Specific Rules

### F1 Content
- Always include lap times or performance data
- Compare to historical context when possible
- Explain technical concepts simply
- Use driver/team badges for visual clarity
- Link insights to strategy, not just results

### Property Content
- Include actual numbers (yields, prices, growth)
- SA market focus, but principles apply broadly
- Show calculations, not just conclusions
- Be honest about risks
- Avoid "get rich quick" energy

### Skincare Content
- Reference studies or ingredients, not hype
- Personal experience + data
- Before/after only with real timelines
- Disclose if products were gifted
- Ingredient focus over brand focus

### Tech/Data Content
- Show code/methods when relevant
- Explain why the approach matters
- Real-world applications
- Accessible to non-technical readers
- Tools and techniques you actually use

---

## Visual Rules

### Screenshots & Charts
- Dark background preferred (matches brand)
- Highlight key data points in pink
- Add annotations explaining what to look at
- Caption every image

### Data Presentation
- Use tables for comparisons
- Use stats grids for key numbers
- Bold the most important figures
- Round numbers for readability (23.7% not 23.6842%)

### Formatting
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Use headers to break up content
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for emphasis, not italics
- One idea per paragraph
- **No em dashes (—)**: use colons, periods, or commas instead

## What NOT to Publish

### Kill the Issue If:
- You don't have real data to back the claim
- It's just summarizing news (add your analysis)
- You're not actually interested in the topic
- It feels forced or filler
- You wouldn't read it yourself

### Red Flags:
- "I should write about this because it's trending"
- "Everyone else is covering this"
- "I need to hit my schedule"
- Writing without a clear insight

**Better to skip a week than publish weak content.**

---

## Content Calendar Rules

### Frequency
- Weekly or every 10 days (quality > consistency)
- Don't publish just to publish
- It's okay to skip if nothing good

### Pillar Rotation
- Don't do 4 F1 issues in a row
- Mix it up to serve all readers
- But go deep when something big happens

### Timing
- F1: Publish Tuesday/Wednesday after race weekends
- Property: Monthly market updates
- Skincare: As you have real insights
- Tech: When you build something cool

---

## Sources & Attribution

### Always Credit:
- Data sources (FastF1, Property24, etc.)
- Studies or research referenced
- Tools you used
- Other creators' ideas (if inspired by)

### How to Credit:
- Link to original source
- "Source: [Name]" under charts
- "h/t @username" if inspired by someone

### Never:
- Present others' analysis as your own
- Use data without knowing the source
- Claim certainty when data is unclear

---

## Improvement Loop

### After Each Issue:
1. Check open rate (target: 45%+)
2. Check click rate (target: 5%+)
3. Count replies received
4. Note what worked/didn't

### Monthly Review:
- Which issues performed best?
- What topics drove engagement?
- What should I do more of?
- What should I drop?

### Iterate:
- Double down on what works
- Kill what doesn't
- Always be testing
