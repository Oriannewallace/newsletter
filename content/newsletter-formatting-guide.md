# The Winning Formula - Newsletter Formatting Guide

## Subject Line Formula

### Rules
- **Length:** 3-7 words, under 60 characters (mobile-friendly)
- **No generic words:** Avoid "Newsletter", "Update", "Weekly"

### Templates for Each Pillar

**F1:**
- "Verstappen was faster. The data proves it."
