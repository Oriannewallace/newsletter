# I Browse Property24 Every Day. Here's What Most People Get Wrong.

*The Winning Formula - Issue #1: Property*

---

I have a confession: I'm addicted to Property24.

Every day - and I mean every day - I open the app. Sometimes it's R50 million Clifton mansions I'll never afford. Sometimes it's rental listings in Observatory to see what the market's doing. It's become a habit, like checking the weather.

But here's what I've learned from all that browsing: **most people compare properties wrong.**

They look at the rental price and think "R15,000/month sounds good." Or they see a cheap purchase price and assume it's a bargain.

Neither tells you the full story.

## The Number That Actually Matters

When I worked in wealth management, I learned that sophisticated investors don't just look at rent or price in isolation. They look at **yield** - the return you get relative to what you paid.

There are two types:

**Gross Yield** = Annual Rent ÷ Purchase Price
- Quick and dirty
- Ignores all the costs that eat into your return

**Net Yield** = (Annual Rent - All Expenses) ÷ Purchase Price
- The real number
- What actually hits your bank account

That second one is what matters. And almost nobody calculates it properly.

## A Real Example

Let's say you're comparing two properties:

**Property A: Sea Point apartment**
- Purchase price: R2,500,000
- Monthly rent: R18,000
- Gross yield: 8.6% ← Looks great!

**Property B: Observatory apartment**
- Purchase price: R1,500,000
- Monthly rent: R12,000
- Gross yield: 9.6% ← Even better!

Property B wins, right?

Not so fast.

When you factor in the actual expenses:

| Expense | Sea Point | Observatory |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Rates | R2,200/mo | R1,400/mo |
| Levies | R4,500/mo | R1,800/mo |
| Insurance | R600/mo | R400/mo |
| Maintenance | R900/mo | R600/mo |
| **Total** | **R8,200/mo** | **R4,200/mo** |

Now the picture changes:

**Property A Net Yield: 4.7%**
**Property B Net Yield: 6.2%**

Property B still wins - but the gap is different than the gross yield suggested. And that Sea Point "8.6% yield" is actually under 5% when you account for those killer levies.

## The Tool I Built

I got tired of doing this math in my head while scrolling Property24. So I built a simple calculator.

You enter:
- Purchase price
- Monthly rent
- Your expenses (rates, levies, insurance, maintenance)
- Vacancy allowance (because tenants leave)

It gives you:
- Gross yield
- Net yield
- Monthly cash flow
- A rating: 🟢 Good (8%+), 🟡 Okay (5-8%), 🔴 Poor (<5%)

You can also compare multiple properties side by side, sorted by best net yield.

## The Benchmarks I Use

From my daily Property24 habit, here's what I've observed in Cape Town:

| Area | Typical Net Yield | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Sea Point / Atlantic Seaboard | 4-6% | High levies kill returns |
| Observatory / Woodstock | 6-8% | Sweet spot for yield |
| CBD | 7-9% | Good yields, higher vacancy risk |
| Bellville / Northern Suburbs | 8-10% | Best pure yield, different lifestyle |

These aren't rules - they're starting points. Every building is different.

## What I'd Actually Do

If I was buying a rental property tomorrow (and I think about this constantly), here's my checklist:

1. **Calculate net yield first** - If it's under 5%, the numbers probably don't work
2. **Check the levy history** - Ask for 3 years of levy statements. Are they increasing fast?
3. **Factor in vacancy** - Budget for 1 month empty per year (8% vacancy)
4. **Compare against alternatives** - Could you get 8% in a money market fund with zero hassle?

The property still needs to make sense as an *investment*, not just feel good as a purchase.

Grab the calculator and run your own numbers. If you're browsing Property24 like me, you might be surprised what the actual yields look like once you factor in expenses.
