# Issue #001: The 2026 F1 Season Starts Now

**Title:** The 2026 F1 Season Starts Now: Here's What You Need to Know

**Subtitle:** Red Bull's new look, Cadillac's first laps, and why this might be the biggest regulation change in F1 history

---

## The season hasn't started, but the story already has.

While most of us were still recovering from the holidays, F1 teams were already making moves. Red Bull unveiled their 2026 livery. Cadillac turned their first laps at Silverstone. And in less than two weeks, we'll see all 22 cars on track together for the first time.

This is the calm before what might be the most chaotic season in F1 history. Let me break down what's happening.

## Red Bull Goes Retro

Red Bull dropped their 2026 livery on January 15th in Detroit, alongside their new Ford partnership. The headline? **They're going back to gloss white.**

This is a callback to their 2005 debut livery. A "heritage white base" designed to make the bull logo pop. After years of matte finishes, the gloss is back.

**The real story:** Max Verstappen is switching from #33 to #3 this season. Why? He's earned it. And it's a subtle flex after losing the 2025 title to Norris.

## Cadillac Hits the Track

The 11th team is real. Cadillac completed their shakedown at Silverstone on January 16th. A black-liveried car turning laps in the British cold.

Their proper livery reveal? **The Super Bowl halftime show.** Yes, really. F1 is going full American.

What we know so far:
- Car ran successfully at Silverstone shakedown
- Full livery coming Feb 9 (Super Bowl)
- They'll join the Barcelona test on Jan 26

## Launch Calendar: Don't Miss These Dates

## Why 2026 Is Different

Sky's Martin Brundle called these regulations **"the biggest changes ever"** in F1. He's not wrong.

What's new:
- **Smaller cars:** finally addressing the "boats" complaint
- **New power units:** more electrical power, sustainable fuels
- **Active aero:** returning after decades
- **11 teams, 22 drivers:** Cadillac joins the grid

The Barcelona test (Jan 26-29) is behind closed doors. No timing data will be public. But leaks always happen. I'll be watching.

## What I'm Tracking

This season, I'm going to analyse:
- How the new aero rules affect overtaking
- Which team adapts fastest to the new regs
- Whether Cadillac can score points in Year 1
- The real pace hidden in testing data

**Subscribers will get access to my race pace dashboards.** The same analysis I used to predict McLaren's 2024 championship run.

## The Bottom Line

Lando Norris is the reigning champion. Max wants his title back. Ferrari and Mercedes are desperate to return to the top. And there's a brand new American team ready to shake things up.

2026 is going to be chaos. And I'm here for it.

**What are you most excited about this season?** Hit reply and let me know.

Until next time,
**Orianne**
