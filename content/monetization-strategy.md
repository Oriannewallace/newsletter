Every free newsletter should hint at paid value:

### Example Hooks:
> "I ran 15 different scenarios on this property. The full breakdown is in The Data Room → [link]"

> "Paid subscribers got this analysis 3 days early. Here's what the data showed..."

> "Want the actual spreadsheet I use? It's in the member templates."

> "Full interactive dashboard where you can filter by driver → [paid link]"

### Soft CTAs (end of each issue):
```

raw data exports, and the templates I actually use.

## Action Plan

### Now (Pre-Launch)

- [ ] Build 2-3 exclusive templates
- [ ] Gate dashboards behind login
- [ ] Write sales page copy

### At 250 Subscribers
- [ ] Soft launch to engaged readers

## Key Insight

**Don't monetize too early.**

Focus on:
1. Building audience (500+ subscribers)
2. Proving value (high open rates, replies)
3. Understanding what people want (ask them!)
4. Creating assets worth paying for

Then monetize. Premature paywalls kill newsletters.
