<p>Last month, a friend asked me to look at an investment property in Kenilworth.</p>

<p>"The yield is 5.2%," he said. "That's solid, right?"</p>

<p>I pulled the data. Within 20 minutes, I found three problems he hadn't considered. The "solid" yield was actually closer to 3.1% once you accounted for reality.</p>

<p>This is what happens when we evaluate suburbs by headline numbers instead of data.</p>

<p>Today, I'll show you exactly how I evaluate a suburb before I even look at a single listing.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Problem With Averages</h2>

<p>When most people research a suburb, they Google "[suburb name] median house price" and call it a day.</p>

<p>Here's why that's dangerous:</p>

<p><strong>Averages hide the distribution.</strong> A suburb with a $750K median could have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most properties clustered around $700-800K (tight market, predictable)</li>
  <li>Half at $500K and half at $1M (split market, completely different dynamics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Same median. Totally different investment thesis.</p>

<p>When I looked at Kenilworth, the median told me nothing useful. The <em>distribution</em> told me everything: there's a clear split between older units and renovated houses, and they behave like two separate markets.</p>

<h2>The Three Numbers I Check First</h2>

<p>Before I look at any listing, I pull three data points:</p>

<h3>1. Days on Market (DOM) Trend</h3>

<p>Not the current DOM. The <em>trend</em> over 12 months.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decreasing DOM</strong> = demand outpacing supply (buyers competing)</li>
  <li><strong>Increasing DOM</strong> = supply building up (sellers competing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kenilworth's DOM has increased 18% over the past year. That's not a red flag yet, but it tells me I have negotiating room that didn't exist 12 months ago.</p>

<h3>2. Stock on Market vs. Sales Rate</h3>

<p>This is the supply/demand equation in its purest form.</p>

<p>Formula: <strong>Stock on Market ÷ Monthly Sales = Months of Inventory</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Under 3 months</strong> = seller's market</li>
  <li><strong>3-6 months</strong> = balanced</li>
  <li><strong>Over 6 months</strong> = buyer's market</li>
</ul>

<p>Kenilworth currently sits at 4.2 months. Balanced, leaning slightly toward buyers. This matches the DOM signal.</p>

<h3>3. Rental Vacancy Rate</h3>

<p>This is where my friend's "5.2% yield" started to fall apart.</p>

<p>He calculated yield assuming 52 weeks of rent. But Kenilworth's vacancy rate is 3.8%—meaning ~2 weeks of vacancy per year on average. For older properties (which his target was), it's closer to 5.2%.</p>

<p>That's nearly 3 weeks of lost rent baked into the suburb's fundamentals.</p>

<h2>The Real Yield Calculation</h2>

<p>Here's how the numbers actually worked out:</p>

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
  <tr style="background-color: #f5f5f5;">
    <th style="padding: 12px; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;">Factor</th>
    <th style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;">His Number</th>
    <th style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;">Reality</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Annual Rent</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">$31,200</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">$29,580 (after vacancy)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Property Management (8%)</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Not included</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">-$2,366</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Maintenance (older property)</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Not included</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">-$3,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Insurance + Rates</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Not included</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">-$5,500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="background-color: #f9f9f9; font-weight: bold;">
    <td style="padding: 12px;">Net Operating Income</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right;">$31,200</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right;">$18,714</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="background-color: #e8f4e8; font-weight: bold;">
    <td style="padding: 12px;">True Yield (on $600K)</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right;">5.2%</td>
    <td style="padding: 12px; text-align: right; color: #c0392b;">3.1%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The property wasn't bad. But at 3.1% net yield with a balanced market showing softening demand signals, the investment thesis changed completely.</p>

<h2>What I Told My Friend</h2>

<p>I didn't tell him not to buy. I told him:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Negotiate harder.</strong> The DOM and inventory data says you have leverage.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget for reality.</strong> Use 3.1% net yield in your cash flow projections, not 5.2%.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider the newer stock.</strong> The vacancy rate for post-2010 builds in the same suburb is 2.1%—that's a full percentage point difference in yield.</li>
</ol>

<p>He ended up negotiating $35K off the asking price and targeting a newer property. Same suburb, completely different outcome—because the data gave him a real picture instead of a hopeful one.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Your Takeaway</h2>

<p>Before you look at a single listing in any suburb:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Check the DOM trend</strong> (not just current—12-month direction)</li>
  <li><strong>Calculate months of inventory</strong> (stock ÷ monthly sales)</li>
  <li><strong>Find the vacancy rate</strong> (and segment by property type if possible)</li>
</ol>

<p>These three numbers take 15 minutes to find and will save you from "solid yields" that aren't solid at all.</p>

<p>Next issue, I'll break down why some yields that look great on paper completely fall apart when you compare them properly—and the one calculation most investors skip.</p>

<p>Until then,<br>
